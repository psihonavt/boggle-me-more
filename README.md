# Boggle Solver

## Introduction 

Create an API for solving Boggle. The API should accept a randomly generated Boggle "board" (a two dimensional array of letters). The API should "solve" the board and return all valid words contained on the board.

We have provided a stub application for you to use as a starting place to work from. You are free use it, or build 
something from scratch. Additionally, you may use any publicly available libraries, tools, and information resources
(see below for some examples). However, we do ask that you come prepared to discuss what resources you used and that 
the final result reflects your own work and thinking. Please be sure to attribute any resources that contributed 
ideas or code to your solution. 

When you're done, please send along the source code (GitHub URL or Zip file) and (if applicable) a live URL.

We've gotten feedback from some candidates that they wished they had a little more clarity on what specifically we're 
looking for in this assignment. Here are a few things we'll be interested in seeing in your solution:

* How easy is it to read, understand and maintain the code?
* How easy to use is the interface?
* How well tested is the implementation?
* How well does it make use of established idioms and best-practices for the chosen toolset? 
* How effective is the solution? How long does it take to solve the puzzle?

Please note, we certainly don't expect that anyone would be able to ace every one of the above,
but we'd love to see a solution that shows off your strengths in some of the above areas and performs reasonably in 
the others. Please note, this is not meant to be a timed assignment. We would rather see your strengths in a few areas, 
instead of a rushed attempt to try and complete everything.
